## Project Description
Organo v3 marks a significant evolution in the Organo team management application series, transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript to leverage enhanced type safety and robust development features. This version focuses on the systematic migration of the React application to TypeScript, introducing strict typing, interfaces, and advanced TypeScript configurations. The migration aims to improve maintainability, scale up the application more efficiently, and reduce runtime errors through compile-time checks.

## Features
- **TypeScript Integration**:
  - Migrates the entire codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript, providing static typing and compile-time error checking.
  - Includes the creation of `tsconfig.json` to customize compiler options for optimized builds.

- **Advanced Typing System**:
  - Implements TypeScript interfaces and types to define the shape of props and state, enhancing code predictability and reliability.
  - Utilizes TypeScript utility types for more complex typing scenarios, improving the application's flexibility and type safety.

- **Component Refactoring**:
  - Refactors existing React components into TypeScript, ensuring all components are type-safe and follow TypeScript best practices.
  - Adds new functionalities with ensured type accuracy, reducing the risk of bugs.

- **JSX Configuration in TypeScript**:
  - Configures JSX compilation in TypeScript via `tsconfig.json`, ensuring seamless integration of JSX into the TypeScript workflow.

- **Optional and Dynamic Typing Features**:
  - Demonstrates the use of optional properties in interfaces and multiple types for the same property to handle various data structures dynamically.
  - Employs non-null assertion operators to handle values that might be null or undefined without compromising type safety.

- **Educational Insights**:
  - Offers a deep dive into TypeScript's features like the difference between `type` and `interface`, setting up optional interface properties, typing functions, and managing JSX in TypeScript projects.
  - Provides practical examples of using `@types` for adding type definitions for packages that do not include them natively.
